 [8/11] SSH version identifier
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 ▶ To identify an SSH communication, both sides send the string
     SSH-protoversion-softwareversion SP comments CR LF
   where
   ◆ protoversion    ... "2.0"
   ◆ softwareversion ... software identifier, such as "OpenSSH_7.2p2"
   ◆ comments        ... optional comment, such as "Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.4"
                         if included, SP must be present
   ◆ maximum length is 255 characters
 ▶ The server may send protoversion "1.99" to denote compatibility with SSH 1.0
 ▶ In the compatibility mode, the version string may be terminated by LF instead
 ▶ The server may optionally send a banner
   ◆ Other lines of data
   ◆ Each line SHOULD be terminated by CR LF and MUST NOT begin with "SSH-"
   ◆ No limit on the line length or their amount
   ◆ Fucking hell
 ▶ Direction?
