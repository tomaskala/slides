 [2/8] What is static analysis (good for)?
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 ■ Quickly find (possible) bugs and style issues in your code
   ▶ Static = without running the code
   ▶ Especially important for interpreted languages like Python
   ▶ Command line tools that fail if some rules are broken
 ■ I'll also include code formatters in the definition
   ▶ Enforce uniform coding style, e.g., {"key": value} vs dict(key=value)
 ■ Not dependent on the developer having written tests
